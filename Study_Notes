# There are four kinds of compute resource you can create:
Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
